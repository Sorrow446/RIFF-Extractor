# RIFF-Extractor
RIFF file extractor written in Go.    
This was written for Dying Light 2, but should also work for other games. I wasn't able to find any existing extractors that work properly with it so I wrote my own.

# Usage
Extract all RIFFs from "streams.aesp" into its directory:   
`re_x64.exe streams.aesp`

Extracted RIFFs can be turned into playable OGGs using the batch file above.
